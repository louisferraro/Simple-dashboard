You are asked to implement a web application that solves the aforementioned problems. 
Any person may register with this application to obtain a user ID and a password. 

There are three user levels:
Superadmin who creates a profile for an event location
(name, location, description, area size, capacity of people it can host, pictures, etc.)
Admin who may host events at a certain location
Person who uses the application to look up information about the various events and sign up for them.


Admin can create events with name, event category, description, time, date, location, contact phone, and contact email address.
Each superadmin is affiliated with one location, each admin is affiliated with one event. 
A user can request to create a new event location/event/or to join an existing one (depending upon who accesses this webpage).
A new event can be created by one or more people, and one of them should be assigned as an administrator. 
A person can view registered events in their dashboard, by time, location.
They can retrieve events according to their level of access or scope. 
A user should be able to see events from all around.
There are different types of events (social, fundraising, tech talks, etc.). Each event can be either public or private. 
Public events can be seen by everyone; private events can be seen by the people who have been sent an invitation by the host. 
Events must be approved by the super admin. 
After an event has been published, users can add it, remove it, edit comments on the event, as well as rating the event with up to 5 stars.
